Current milestone: "M018 — Farm State schema (crop, stage, planting date, signal cache)"
Completed milestones: ["M001", "M002", "M003", "M004", "M005", "M006", "M007", "M008", "M009", "M010", "M011", "M012", "M013", "M014", "M015", "M016", "M017"]
Current implementation status: "M017 done: cross-resource authorization audit (IDOR pass) — tests/api/test_idor.py (13 tests) covering the whole /api/v1 surface: route-inventory default-deny driven from the real app's OpenAPI schema (15 non-public ops -> 401 anon; allow-list exact), cross-tenant profile/farm/plot 404 with byte-identical body vs missing id (no oracle), mass-assignment probes (user_id/role/password_hash/farmer_id/farm_id immutable, DB-verified), list scoping + no-profile farmer, malformed UUID -> 422 (anon -> 401), sanitized error bodies, officer 404/403 ordering. No defects found in src/ — zero production-code changes."
Known bugs: []
Known security issues:
  - "Open (by design until M055): login/refresh have no rate limiting (flagged since M009); /docs+/redoc+/openapi.json public (documented hackathon decision, SECURITY.md in M059)."
Known performance issues: []
Known resource/memory issues:
  - "Residual (documented, not reproducible locally): asyncio.wait_for cancelling /ready's check mid real-socket cleanup; SQLAlchemy pool handles greenlet cancellation — re-measure in M056. Refused-connection path asserted clean (checkedout()==0)."
Technical debt:
  - "Autogenerate migrations must ALWAYS be hand-reviewed — M008 caught a duplicated same-name CHECK constraint in the generated output."
  - "Error-shape inconsistency: Starlette route-mismatch 404 returns {detail} while AppError 404 returns {error_code,message} — no leak, optional HTTPException handler unification deferred to M055 (M017 finding)."
Blocked tasks: []
Next milestone: "M018 — Farm State schema (crop, stage, planting date, signal cache)"
Last verification: "M017 gate PASSED with live dev DB (65432, PostGIS 3.4): ruff format OK, ruff check OK, mypy OK, pytest 178 passed / 0 skipped (13 new IDOR); bandit on tests/api/test_idor.py 0 medium/high; pip-audit clean. Live uvicorn 8/8 (anon inventory 15/15 -> 401, allow-list exact, cross-tenant 404 oracle-free, mass-assign ignored in DB, malformed uuid 422) + live artifact cleanup before final gate."
Last test result: "pytest = 178 passed (idor 13, plots-API 13, farms-API 15, farmers-API 15, auth 14, health 9, rbac 11, root 4, config 8, db 4, redact 3, errors 8, logging 4, security 17, user 6, farm-model 11, farmer-model 8, plot-model 11, migrations 2, smoke 2)"

## Checkpoint decisions (human-confirmed, 2026-09-26)

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | Section 3 locked architecture — confirmed as-is |
| D2 | Dev commands → `uv run ruff|mypy|pytest` + `scripts/check.ps1` (no make/just on this Windows host) |
| D3 | Password hashing → `passlib[bcrypt]` + pin `bcrypt==4.0.1` (revisit in M055) |
| D4 | Authorized system actions: `git init`; start Docker Desktop when M003+ verification needs the dev Postgres |
| D5 | JWT library → **PyJWT** (Section 3 allows "python-jose or pyjwt") |
| D6 | Python → **3.12** pinned via `.python-version` / `requires-python` |
| D7 | Farm geometry → **PostGIS `geometry(Geometry, 4326)` column** (human-confirmed 2026-09-27; rejected GeoJSON-in-JSONB and plain lat/lng point). DB image becomes `postgis/postgis:16-3.4`, new pinned dep `geoalchemy2`. |

## Notes / findings

- 2026-09-27: `MILESTONES.md` repaired. A PowerShell 5.1 `Add-Content` (ANSI)
  append had introduced invalid UTF-8 byte `0x97` at offset 6520 plus mojibake
  (`P0 ??`, `M001 ?`, `→`/`—`). Rewritten UTF-8-safe; `ruff format --check`
  exits 0 again. **Lesson: never use PS 5.1 `Add-Content`/`Set-Content` for
  repo text files; use the UTF-8-safe file tools.**
- 2026-09-27: Added real `__init__.py` files to `src/`, all eight subpackages
  and `workers/` (previously empty dirs → implicit namespace packages with
  `__file__ = None`). mypy now sees 11 source files.
- `pwsh` (PowerShell 7) is not on PATH on this host; the gate must be invoked
  as `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check.ps1`.
- 2026-09-27 (M007): This host runs **native PostgreSQL 17 (5432) and 18 (5433)**
  Windows services — never publish the dev container to 5432/5433.
- 2026-09-27 (M007): **Dev DB host port changed 55432 → 65432.** Port 55432
  landed inside a Windows/Hyper-V dynamic exclusion range (55345–55444 per
  `netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp`) and could no
  longer bind. Ranges are dynamic — re-run the netsh check if binding fails
  after a reboot. Updated in `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, `.env.example`,
  README, and the M003 deviation note in `MILESTONES.md`.
- 2026-09-27 (M007): The opencode host **process** environment carries a stale
  `DATABASE_URL` (port 55432); real env vars override `.env` in
  pydantic-settings, so verification commands must run as
  `$env:DATABASE_URL=$null; <cmd>` until the host process is restarted with
  it unset. Not persisted at User/Machine scope.
- 2026-09-27 (M007): `.env` edit via PS5.1 `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8`
  silently prepended a BOM; stripped via `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText` with
  `UTF8Encoding($false)`. Reinforces the UTF-8 lesson above — even for
  gitignored local files, prefer the UTF-8-safe file tools.
- 2026-09-27 (M009): **Removed stock `fileConfig()` from `alembic/env.py`.**
  Alembic's ini-driven logging config reset the root logger and disabled
  existing `agrin.*` loggers once in-process migrations ran before API tests,
  breaking caplog assertions in `tests/api/test_health.py`. App owns logging
  (`src/core/logging.py`).
- 2026-09-27 (M009): ruff **B008** rejects `Depends(...)` in parameter
  defaults — repo convention is now `Annotated[X, Depends(...)]` (aliases
  `SessionDep`/`CredentialsDep` in `src/api/deps.py`). Use for all future
  FastAPI dependencies/params.
- 2026-09-27 (M009): killing a `uv run uvicorn ...` Start-Process wrapper
  leaves the child python.exe listening on the port — kill by the PID from
  `netstat -ano | Select-String ":8000.*LISTENING"` or the stale server
  serves old code (caused a confusing live 404).
- 2026-09-27 (M010): dev DB `users` table was empty at live verification —
  the container had been recreated between sessions without a named volume
  for that data path. Seeded rows do not survive; re-seed demo users after
  any container recreation (tests unaffected: they seed/clean their own).
- 2026-09-27 (M010): route-handler gates must use the no-default form
  `Annotated[User, Depends(require_role(...))]` — putting `Depends(...)`
  in a parameter *default* trips ruff B008.
- 2026-09-27 (M011): `.gitignore` currently carries an uncommitted local
  edit (`.github` appended, no trailing newline) — not part of M011's
  commit; confirm intent (ignore or track `.github/`) before committing it.
- 2026-09-27 (M012): **Every gate run destroys seeded dev data** —
  `tests/test_migrations.py` round-trip executes `downgrade base` +
  `upgrade head`, reinitializing the whole schema (accounts included).
  Always seed demo users/fixtures **after** the final gate run; a re-gate
  after seeding invalidates the seeds (caused mid-verification 401/405
  confusion). Kept as-is (the round-trip is the point of that test).
- 2026-09-27 (M012): Fixed a second data-wipe source: `test_farmer.py`
  teardowns used unscoped `DELETE FROM users`; now scoped to seeded ids
  (FK cascade cleans their farmer rows). House rule: test cleanup must
  always scope deletes to rows the test created.
- 2026-09-28 (M017): This host has **two** `Temp\opencode` directories
  (`C:\Users\91797\...` and `C:\Personal\91797\...`); files written via
  the file tool landed in the latter. When running a temp script, use
  the exact path reported at write time, not `$env:TEMP\opencode`.
- 2026-09-28 (M017): `live_m017.py` + the audit live checks run against
  a real `uvicorn src.main:app --port 8000` child process — kill it by
  the PID from `netstat -ano | Select-String ":8000.*LISTENING"` (M009
  lesson) before re-running tests.
